        <p class = "flex-item">I grew up in a bit of an odd home. My parents are immigrants from Egypt, and although I ate a lot of Egyptian food growing up, my mother also liked to experiment with food from other cultures. I've been meaning to get her recipes down and organized in one place for a while, so here they are!</p>

        <h2>Taamayya (Egyptian falafel)<i class="fas fa-seedling"></i><i class="fas fa-seedling"></i></h2>
            <p>Egyptian falafel is usually made with fava beans, not chick peas, and is a flat patty instead of a lump or ball. It's usually eaten for breakfast with foule.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>1 C peeled, split fava beans, soaked overnight</li>
                <li>1 leek, dark part removed</li>
                <li>parsley to taste</li>
                <li>cilantro to taste</li>
                <li>1 T salt</li>
                <li>1/2 t baking soda</li>
                <li>sesame seeds</li>
                <li>whole coriander seeds</li>

            </ul>

            <p>
                Discard soaking water and combine fava beans with leek, parsley, cilantro, and salt in a food processor. Blend until you have a smooth paste. You can save this batter in the freezer or cook immediately. When you're ready to cook, add baking soda and mix well. Scoop into 1-2 T portions with a spoon and dip into a mixture of the sesame and coriander seeds. Flaten each portion into a paper towel to make a patty and absorb some excess moisture. Deep fry on medium high heat, using a small frying pan. Don't overcrowd the pan as they cook extremely quickly
